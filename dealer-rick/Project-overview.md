# Blackjack

I want to create a blackjack discord bot that anyone in the sever can use. I would like all of the traditional rules of blackjack to be implemented into this bot(that includes splitting and doubling down). there should be a coin system where everybody starts with 1000 coins. If you run out of coins, you can get get more coins. However, if a user goes bankrupt, the discord bot should ping everyone in the sever and say "Hey everyone, {users name goes here} just lost everything in blackjack, laugh at this loser one time". Also, when a user returns to play blackjack, they should continue with the same amount of coins that they left with. I also would like to have a cool UI for the cards.
I will be deploying this bot on railway.
